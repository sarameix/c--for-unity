# AR-furniture-placement

The scripts within this repository were created for use in an augmented reality application built in Unity for Android phones.

The app and scripts use Unity's AR Foundation and Lean Touch packages to spawn and transform furniture objects on a ground plane that is automatically detected through a smartphone camera.
It also allows for the user to screenshot what the objects look like in their room and scroll through and delete captured images.
